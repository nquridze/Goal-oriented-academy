    <p>This is Goal-oriented academy, a place where you learn about coding and business.<br> I am a new student in GOA, and i enjoy my time here because the community<br> is friendly and supportive, so are the mentors, which try their best to<br> pass their knowledge onto us. Their technique is good,<br>so are the 10 minute breaks in which we physically drain, doing training.<br>I like GOA for these reasons and this is why i reccomend it to you,</p>
